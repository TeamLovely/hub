To succeed as individuals, colleagues, and as professionals, it’s important to us that we have a clear set of values to live and work by. At Lovely, we find these to be so important that we’re prepared to earn them from others every single day by exemplifying them ourselves.

## Respect
Give respect every day, and earn it back.
##Courage
Be creative and take risks.
## Transparency
Be honest and have integrity in everything you do.
## Empathy
Understand the motivation of others to build stronger community and create better solutions.
## Celebration
Recognize our wins, use them as fuel to drive future success.
## Accountability
Take ownership over the success and failure of the company, no excuses.
## Hard Work
Always pursue excellence, even in the face of failure.
## Growth
Self reflect, seek to improve, and never get complacent.
## Humility
Let the best idea win, and get on the bus once a decision is made.
