description: At the heart of Lovely Direct is the desire to simplify renting in a new way for both sides of the marketplace. Landlords want to lease the properties quickly and with minimal effort, while leasing their units for a fair price. Renters want to have a smooth and transparent experience free of scams, unresponsive communication, and hidden fees. To accomplish this, Lovely Direct is offering a full service solution to give us control of  inventory so that we will be able to make promises to both landlords and renters. <br /><br />For landlord we can ensure proposing qualified renters within a given time window, through our individualized listing creations, data driven pricing, and thorough screenings. For renters, we can ensure efficient response rates, clearly communicate all the requirements, and secure and simplify the application process.
renter application: Applications have a nasty habit of asking questions that aren't relevant to a renter's qualifications for an apartment. Renters send out myriad paper applications containing their sensitive information to nameless landlords. The fate of these applications is often times unknown. A landlord might not respond, a “landlord” may be just trying to collect data for nefarious purposes. In either scenario, it leaves a renter feeling uneasy and powerless. By “cutting the fat” and  bringing the application online, we cut away the repetition of filling out the same application and let a renter know exactly where their app is going, to us here at Lovely and and to landlords that are interested. We run background a credit checks and show a Landlord only the most basic information to keep a renters personally identifiable information (PII) safe.
tenant proposal and lease completion: “It ain't over till the fat lady sings” Probably more true in lease signing than any other agreement. Tenants flake, landlords flake. Nothing is a done deal until both parties have signed and 1st month's rent and security deposit are securely in the hands of the property owner. Lovely Direct aims to close the loop as quickly and efficiently as possible while alerting respective parties as soon as something goes awry.
